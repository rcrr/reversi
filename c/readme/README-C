This file describes the configuration and settings done to prepare the C environment used to develop and execute
the REVERSI program.

Software components being used are:

 - Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS (x86_64)
 - gcc (Ubuntu 13.2.0-23ubuntu4) 13.2.0
 - GNU C Library (Ubuntu GLIBC 2.39-0ubuntu8.3) stable release version 2.39
 - doxygen 1.9.8
 - psql (PostgreSQL) 16.4 (Ubuntu 16.4-0ubuntu0.24.04.2)
 - libpq-dev 16.4-0ubuntu0.24.04.2 amd64
 - libbliss : https://github.com/flame/blis
 - libflame : https://github.com/flame/libflame
 - openmp
 - blas

Run the following commands in a terminal:

$ make clean
$ make
$ make test
$ make doxygen
$ make endgame_log_files
$ make endgame_pv_files
$ make dat2csv
$ make asm

Everything is build under the ./build directory.

One shared library is generated, used by the python code, in ./build/lib:
  reversi.so

Nine executables are created in ./build/bin:
 endgame_solver
 gpdb_verify
 intel_intrinsics_trial
 read_game_tree_log
 read_pve_dump
 regab
 rglm
 rglmw
 utest

endgame_solver is the main program, it is the entry point for several solvers and utilities.
Run 'endgame_solver -h' for help and options.

gpdb_verify (game position database consistency verifier) is a tool that reads and verifies a file based database of game position.
Run 'gpdb_verify -h' for help and options.

regab (reversi endgame analytics base) is a tool to generate, solve and extract game positions from an SQL database.
Run 'regab -h' for help and options.

rglm (reversi generalized linear model solver) is a group of tools dedicated to solve and process a model to estimate the outcome of a game.
Run 'rglm -h' for help and options.

rglmw (reversi generalized linear model weights) is a tool used to evaluate the goodnes of a computed model.
Run 'rglmw -h' for help and options.

utest is an unit test utility.
Run 'utest -h' for help and options.
