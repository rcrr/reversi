This file describes the configuration and settings done to prepare the C environment used to develop and execute
the REVERSI program.

Software components being used are:

 - Ubuntu distribution 14.04 (x86_64)
 - GCC 4.8.2
 - glib libglib-2.0 (https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/)
 - doxygen 1.8.6
 - The GNU/Linux toolchain
 - GNU GSL package (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

To install the GSL software run:

$ sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dbg libgsl0-dev libgsl0

Run the following commands in a terminal:

$ make clean
$ make
$ make test
$ make doxygen
$ make endgame_log_files

Everything is build under the ./build directory.

Three executables are created in ./build/bin:
  endgame_solver
  gpdb_verify
  dump_bitrow_changes

endgame_solver is the main program, it is the entry point for several solvers and utilities.
Run 'endgame_solver -h' for help and options.

gpdb_verify (game position database consistency verifier) is a tool that reads and verifies a file based database of game position.
Run 'gpdb_verify -h' for help and options.

dump_bitrow_changes is an utility for testing the table generated by the endgame_solver at runtime and used for game move computation.
It generates on sdtout a list of 524,288 rows having as columns: ARRAY_INDEX;PLAYER_ROW;OPPONENT_ROW;MOVE_POSITION;PLAYER_CHANGES.
