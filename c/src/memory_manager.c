 * @details Memory management by mean of block allocation is a technique designed to

 *
 *          All the symbols exported by the module adopt the `mem_` prefix.

 * Memory tracking policy.
 *
 * MT_TRACK and MT_NO_TRACK should be self-explanatory.
 * MT_FAIL_COUNT takes an
 * argument specifying after how many allocations further allocations should always fail.
 * MT_FAIL_PERCENT takes an argument specifying an integer percentage of allocations to
 * randomly fail.
 *
 * MT_SUBALLOC causes small blocks to be carved out of larger ones allocated with malloc().
 * This is a good idea for two reasons: malloc() can be slow and malloc() can waste a lot of
 * space dealing with the small blocks that Libavl uses for its node. Suballocation cannot be
 * implemented in an entirely portable way because of alignment issues, but the test program
 * here requires the user to specify the alignment needed, and its use is optional anyhow.

 * A memory block.
 *
 * The memory manager keeps track of allocated blocks using struct block.
 *
 * The next member of struct block is used to keep a linked list of all the currently allocated
 * blocks. Searching this list is inefficient, but there are at least two reasons to do it this way,
 * instead of using a more efficient data structure, such as a binary tree. First, this code is for
 * testing binary tree routinesâ€”using a binary tree data structure to do it is a strange idea!
 * Second, the ISO C standard says that, with few exceptions, using the relational operators
 * (<, <=, >, >=) to compare pointers that do not point inside the same array produces
 * undefined behavior, but allows use of the equality operators (==, !=) for a larger class of
 * pointers.
