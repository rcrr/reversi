 * MEM_MT_SUBALLOC causes small blocks to be carved out of larger ones allocated with malloc().
 * This is a good idea for two reasons: malloc() can be slow and malloc() can waste a lot of
 * space dealing with the small blocks that Libavl uses for its node. Suballocation cannot be
 * implemented in an entirely portable way because of alignment issues, but the test program
 * here requires the user to specify the alignment needed, and its use is optional anyhow.

 *
 * The next member of mem_mt_block_t is used to keep a linked list of all the currently allocated
 * blocks. Searching this list is inefficient, but there are at least two reasons to do it this way,
 * instead of using a more efficient data structure, such as a binary tree. First, this code is for
 * testing binary tree routinesâ€”using a binary tree data structure to do it is a strange idea!
 * Second, the ISO C standard says that, with few exceptions, using the relational operators
 * (<, <=, >, >=) to compare pointers that do not point inside the same array produces
 * undefined behavior, but allows use of the equality operators (==, !=) for a larger class of
 * pointers.
