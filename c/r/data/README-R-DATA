This file describes how to generate data files from the SQL database.

Connect to the dabase using psql client:

psql> SET search_path TO reversi;

psql> \COPY (SELECT cl.index_value, gp.game_value, count(1) FROM regab_prng_gp_classification AS cl LEFT JOIN regab_prng_gp AS gp ON cl.gp_id = gp.seq WHERE cl.class_id = 1 GROUP BY cl.index_value, gp.game_value ORDER BY cl.index_value, gp.game_value) TO 'out_cid_01.csv' WITH DELIMITER ';' CSV HEADER;
psql> \COPY (WITH aa AS (SELECT cl.class_id AS class_id, cl.index_value AS index_value, gp.game_value AS game_value, count(1) AS cnt FROM regab_prng_gp_classification AS cl LEFT JOIN regab_prng_gp AS gp ON cl.gp_id = gp.seq GROUP BY cl.class_id, gp.game_value, cl.index_value ORDER BY cl.class_id, gp.game_value, cl.index_value), bb AS (SELECT ch.empty_count AS empty_count, aa.index_value AS index_value, aa.game_value AS game_value, aa.cnt AS cnt FROM aa LEFT JOIN regab_prng_gp_classification_h AS ch ON aa.class_id = ch.seq ORDER BY empty_count, index_value, game_value) SELECT * FROM bb)  TO 'out_ec_pid_value_cnt.csv' WITH DELIMITER ';' CSV HEADER;
