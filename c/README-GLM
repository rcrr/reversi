This file describes the procedure to compose and solve the GLM (Generalized Linear Problem) problem.


First step is to extract the data from the REGAB database. Data is structured as a set of solved positions.
Extraction happens by selecting:

 - a set of batch_id values
 - a set of game position statuses
 - one single empty_count value
 - an ordered set of board patterns

And by specifying an output file:

 $ regab --action extract --config-file regab.cfg --env test --batch-id 1,3,5 --position-status CMS,CMR --empty-count 20 --pattern EDGE,R2,R3,R4 --out-file solved_positions.dat
